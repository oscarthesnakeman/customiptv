# customiptv

Just a customised Iptv channels set I made for cricket, golf, football and tnt sports channels.

Instead of using this Iptv service as it might not have the stuff you want, I would highly recommend using Iptv-org.

If you for some reason do want to use my iptv here us the m3u url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscarthesnakeman/customiptv/refs/heads/main/skytnt.m3u
